                    POUND® is a full-body cardio and conditioning class that allows you to rock
                    using lightly weighted exercise drumsticks, called Ripstix™.<br>
                    Barry has been running dance fitness classes for over 6yrs in the Blackpool
                    area, and is very excited to now be offering this 360 degree body workout. Barry
                    is sure this special workout is going to be a hit amongst his fabulous fitness
                    following and is offering 45 minute classes on Fridays, 7.15pm @ Holy Family on
                    Links Rd.

                    POUND® distracts you from the high-intensity and duration of your workout, and
                    shifts your focus to rhythm and volume. This is responsible for the
                    "addictiveness" of POUND® - the reason you can't stay away! Songs consist of
                    interval peaks and extended fat burning sequences, providing you with the best
                    workout in the shortest span of time. After you’re done rocking out in a POUND
                    class, you’ll have completed up to 15,000 reps, performed over 30 extended
                    interval peaks, and zipped through more than 70 techniques without even
                    realizing it.
