It can seem daunting when you take the plunge to start something new, alone or even with friends. However, I can guarantee that the classes are friendly and welcoming.</p>

				So... I’m originally from Warrington and after completing my BA/BSC Hons in Business and Marketing , I decided to move to Blackpool in 2000 to study Dance at Phil Winstons Theatre Works.

I have danced for as long as I can remember, having had the opportunity to travel the world on various contracts. 

This changed in 2008 after a family bereavement. I changed career and became a Business and Marketing Manager. Although I enjoyed the career change, there was something missing in my life - Dancing.

				In 2011, I was made redundant and had the opportunity to persue Dance again. This is when I found Zumba and wanted to share the happiness it brings

I embarked on starting my own Fitness Business, with just 6 classes a week. The demand for classes soared and I was more than happy to oblige. My classes are not only popular, they bring people together. Everyone is a stranger when they first walk in but walk out as friends and become part of the Zumba Family. 

If you haven’t yet tried a class, you’re missing out on the best form of socialising.

My latest achievement was to be shortlisted for Best Male Instructor of The Year, where I was awarded runner up.

Since starting my business , I have continued to expand due to demand and have qualified to teach Zumba Gold, Zumba Toning, Zumba Kids, Clubbercise, Pound Fitness and SOSA Dance Fitness.

I offer a wide variety of classes, which help with mobility, increase fitness levels, tone, gain confidence, improve coordination and make friends.

So if you are looking for something new and exciting, that will be enjoyable and NEVER a chore, take a look at my timetable.

I genuinely look forward to meeting you at one of my classes soon .
